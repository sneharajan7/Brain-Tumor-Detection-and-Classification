# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification
Brain tumors are abnormal growths that occur in the brain tissue, and their early
detection is critical for effective treatment. In recent years, there has been a
growing interest in the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems
for brain tumor detection, which use advanced imaging techniques and machine
learning algorithms to assist radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of brain
tumors. ML has a wide variety of applications which will be useful to detect any
patterns of certain diseases within patient electronic healthcare records and it is
not subjected to any past experiences like humanâ€™s.Medical data has a lot of
privacy concerns, so it is not widely available. Also the format and quality of data
do arise other challenges like effort to clean and preprocessing. Our Aim is to
select the best data available and build models for diagnosing. The proposed
system is evaluated on a publicly available dataset of MRI brain scans, and
achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting brain tumors. The
system's performance is further compared to other state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its superior performance in terms of detection accuracy and
computational efficiency. Overall, the proposed brain tumor detection system has
the potential to assist radiologists in the early detection and diagnosis of brain
tumors, leading to better treatment outcomes and improved patient care.
